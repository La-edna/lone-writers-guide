How to swim in the deep water - A lone writerâ€™s guide to survival
=================================================================

Starting notes:
---------------

* Working with your manager (and others) who know nothing about managing docs. Most sole writers report to a product manager. Some report to marketing or support.  But all report to someone who is not (and has never been) a doc team manager.  Important to educate manager about what it takes to write and publish docs, how long things take (processes), what tools are needed (and why), etc. 

Hack-a-thon content:
--------------------
* Managing expectations
* Time estimates
* Transparency and communication
** Scope - what is the doc writers responsibility, and what is not
* Dependencies - make sure your manager understands what information you need and from who - and the impact on your work
